A **phenom**enological model of X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) radiation.

The PHENOM python package is designed to provide a simple, robust and computationally efficient method for generating representations of the complex wavefield of X-ray Free Electron Laser pulses. By making use of approximate representations of pulse wavefront and [spectra](https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ol-35-20-3441), phenom allows large ensembles of photon pulses with arbitrary statistics to be generated in a truly python-ised manner.

## Getting Started
At the command line::

    $ pip install phenom-xfel

To check that your instillation has worked, open iPython and try::

    $ import phenom
    
## Examples
Phenom has been designed to require minimal knowledge of the XFEL process prior to generating your first pulse.
